# Airbnb Calculator Documentation

## üìå Overview
The Airbnb calculator estimates property profitability by analyzing key metrics including nightly rates, occupancy, operating expenses, and financing assumptions. It provides investors with a comprehensive view of potential returns on short-term rental properties.

## üß† Calculation Flow

### 1. Mortgage Calculation
```typescript
// Inputs: purchasePrice, downPaymentPercent, interestRate, loanTerm
const downPayment = (purchasePrice * downPaymentPercent) / 100;
const loanAmount = purchasePrice - downPayment;
const monthlyInterestRate = interestRate / 100 / 12;
const numberOfPayments = loanTerm * 12;
const monthlyMortgagePayment = (loanAmount * (monthlyInterestRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments))) / (Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments) - 1);
```

### 2. Operating Expenses
```typescript
// Fixed Monthly Expenses
const monthlyPropertyTax = propertyTaxAnnual / 12;
const monthlyInsurance = insuranceAnnual / 12;
const monthlyMaintenance = (purchasePrice * maintenancePercent) / 100 / 12;

// Variable Monthly Expenses
const monthlyCleaningFees = cleaningFee * nightsBooked;
const monthlyPlatformFees = (monthlyRevenue * platformFeesPercent) / 100;
const monthlyPropertyManagement = (monthlyRevenue * propertyManagementPercent) / 100;

const monthlyOperatingExpenses = monthlyPropertyTax + monthlyInsurance + utilitiesMonthly + monthlyMaintenance + monthlyPropertyManagement;
```

### 3. Revenue Calculation
```typescript
// Inputs: nightlyRate, occupancyRate, cleaningFee
const nightsBooked = (30 * occupancyRate) / 100;
const monthlyCleaningFees = cleaningFee * nightsBooked;
const monthlyRevenue = nightlyRate * nightsBooked + monthlyCleaningFees;
```

### 4. Cash Flow & Returns
```typescript
const monthlyCashFlow = monthlyRevenue - monthlyMortgagePayment - monthlyOperatingExpenses;
const annualCashFlow = monthlyCashFlow * 12;
const capRate = (annualCashFlow / purchasePrice) * 100;
const cashOnCashReturn = (annualCashFlow / downPayment) * 100;
```
